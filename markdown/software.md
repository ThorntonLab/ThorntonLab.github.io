##Software from the Thornton lab

###C++ software libraries

* [libsequence](https://github.com/molpopgen/libsequence) is a C++ software library for evolutionary genetic analysis.  The citation for this work is a [paper from 2003](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/17/2325.short)

* [fwdpp](https://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpp) is a C++ template library for developing forward-time simulations under population- and quantitative- genetic models.  I published a description of the library in [Genetics](http://www.genetics.org/content/198/1/157.abstract)

###Simulation software

* [Code] for simulating a neutral coalescent process for copy-number variants that I used in [Thornton 2007](http://www.genetics.org/content/177/2/987.abstract)

* [Code](https://github.com/molpopgen/sweepsims) from [Thornton and Jensen (2007)](http://www.genetics.org/content/175/2/737.abstract). This code simulates a sweep in a bottlenecked population, plus the ancestral population. See paper for details.

* [Code](https://github.com/molpopgen/sweepsims) for models of recurrent hitch-hlking used in [Jensen, Thornton and Andolfatto (2008) PLoS Genetics](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000198)

###Tools for data analysis

* [analysis](https://github.com/molpopgen/analysis) programs for the (pre-NGS-era) analysis of population-genetic data.

* [sequtils](https://github.com/molpopgen/sequtils) is a set of tools for manipulation of (pre-NGS-era) sequence data. (Probably only for old folks at this point in time...)

* [ABCreg](https://github.com/molpopgen/abreg) is a tool for performing statistical inference via approximate Bayesian computation, or ABC.  The software was first described [here](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/35).
