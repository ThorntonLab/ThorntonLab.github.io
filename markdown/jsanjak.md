## Jaleal Sanjak

I am graduate student the in the Department of [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](http://ecoevo.bio.uci.edu) at the [University of California, Irvine](http://www.uci.edu). I joined the Thornton Lab in the Summer of 2014 after completing UCI's [Mathematical and Computational Biology Program](http://mcsb.uci.edu/). Prior to UCI, I worked in public health and biosecurity consulting at [Gryphon Scientific, LLC](http://www.gryphonscientific.com/).
