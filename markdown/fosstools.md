## (Mostly...) Free, open-source software that we use

### A note on ergonomics

My lab edits text files.  That's the day-to-day activity for lab members.  Doing so puts you at risk of various
repetitive stress injuries.  I (KRT, the PI) and 6'4" and have broad shoulders, which means that small keyboards lead to
back/neck issues.  My solution is the [Ergodox EZ](http://ergodox-ez.com).  It is not for everyone, and it really slowed
me down for a while, but I love it now.

### Text editing

* [neovim](http://neovim.io) or [vim](http://www.vim.org).  vim 8.1 added a built-in terminal a la neovim, meaning that
  the differences between the two go away for most people. (neovim will let you write plugins using languages other than
  vimscript, but that's not something that we "do".)


### Software development


### Manuscript preparation

* LaTeX. I "like" LaTeX, but in a Stockholm syndrome sort of way. One day, I hope to switch to a Markdown/Pandoc work
  flow, but the activation energy to change is high.  Thomas Mailund has a nice little
  [pamphlet](https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-Markdown-Pandoc-ebook/dp/B06XYPLZC1) on setting up and using this
  system.
* [Libre Office](http://www.libreoffice.org) seems to do a decent job for presentations.  If you keep it simple, this is
  probably preferable to Beamer.
* [Paperpile](http://paperpile.com) is a Chrome plugin for reference management.  It costs about $30US/year.
