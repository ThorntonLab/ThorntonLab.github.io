## Guidelines for editing

The guidelines are:

* New pages are usually written in `markdown` and placed in the folder `markdown/`.
* New pages need to be linked *to* from an existing page.
* If you add something to the navigation side bar, the changes to in `_config.yml`.
* It is best to stick to starting each sentence on a new line.
  This "rule" makes pull requests easier to review.
* New "blog posts" go in `_posts/` and the name should be `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-TOPIC.md`.
  If the `TOPIC` has multiple words, separate them with a `-`.
  You may also use `html` files for blog posts.
* Submit your changes as a pull request.
  Review is required prior to merging.
  Hopefully the review will catch goofs like pages that aren't linked to, etc..
